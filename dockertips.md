**Understanding the Storage Issue with Docker Containers**

While `docker kill <pid>` effectively terminates a container, it doesn't automatically remove its associated data. This data, including layers of the image and container's state, can accumulate over time, leading to storage consumption.

**Here's a breakdown of what might be contributing to the storage usage:**

1. **Image Layers:**
   - Each `docker pull` command downloads an image, which is composed of multiple layers. 
   - These layers are cached locally, even if you delete the container.
2. **Container Data:**
   - When you run a container, it creates a writable layer on top of the image layers.
   - This layer can store data generated by the container, such as logs, temporary files, or user-generated content.
   - Even after killing a container, its data layer might persist unless explicitly removed.

**Cleaning Up Your Docker Environment**

To manage storage effectively, consider these steps:

1. **Remove Unused Images:**
   - **Identify Unused Images:**
     ```bash
     docker images -f "dangling=true"
     ```
   - **Remove Unused Images:**
     ```bash
     docker image prune
     ```
2. **Remove Stopped Containers:**
   - **List Stopped Containers:**
     ```bash
     docker ps -a
     ```
   - **Remove Stopped Containers:**
     ```bash
     docker container prune
     ```
3. **Remove Volumes:**
   - **List Volumes:**
     ```bash
     docker volume ls
     ```
   - **Remove Unused Volumes:**
     ```bash
     docker volume rm <volume_name>
     ```
4. **Optimize Image Storage:**
   - Use image optimization tools like `docker image prune` to remove unused image layers.
   - Consider using a container registry like Docker Hub to store frequently used images, reducing local storage usage.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Clean Up Regularly:** Make it a habit to periodically clean up your Docker environment to prevent excessive storage usage.
- **Use Docker Compose:** For complex applications, Docker Compose can help manage multiple containers and their dependencies efficiently.
- **Explore Docker's Storage Drivers:** Understand the different storage drivers available and choose one that suits your needs and storage constraints.
